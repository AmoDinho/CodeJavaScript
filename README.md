# CodeJavaScript üçâ  ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)

#CodeJavaScript is a programme designed to get you up to speed with the technologies we use at PMB. It is also meant to be a bridge to help those of you who have never programmed before or are interns to get equipped with the necessary skills to ship code at PMB.

You will use only two resources that will structure this course. You will make three apps at the end of this course, one will be a Serverless Full Stack Node App and a Fullstack GraphQL App. After completing these materials you then build a Full-Stack Serverless GraphQL app that PMB can use internally. This will determine whether you can work here fulltime. You will have about 5-6 months to complete everything. 3 months to complete the tutorials and 3 months for the project. 

You can not start this course if you do not know how to use version control. Please work through the GitHub training labs if you are not familiar with Git.  [GitHub labs](https://lab.github.com/courses)

It is important that you do the projects in the order presented.

# Serverless Stack

[Link](https://serverless-stack.com)

Here you will learn how to make Serverless functions in Node, AWS, CI/CD and Unit Testing. You will also build a front-end in React. 

# How To GraphQL

[Link](https://www.howtographql.com/)

The main point of this is to teach you GraphQL, the previous tut taught you how to make a REST API. You will make a serverful application using Prisma. 

First make sure you go through the fundamentals and Advanced GraphQL sections

Then start with the [GraphQL Node](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/) tut.

Then do the [React + Apollo](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/) tut

# Capstone Project üõ†

Your goal here is to create a Full Stack Serverless GraphQL App that should be available at a deployed URL. The App can be anything you want it to be.  It will get reviewed and based off of it we will make you an offer.  The App has to have Auth, 4 Valid user stories, Unit Tests and a CI/CD pipeline. Use the [Serverless-GraphQL-NodeJS-Starter](https://github.com/pimp-my-book/serverless-graphql-nodejs-starter) to scaffold your project.

# Will I Be Able to  Build Stuff After Completing This? ü§î

Fine question there...a wise person once said that everything you do needs to be reproducable by someone else. In that case here are projects by people who have completed the curriculum and shipped their own Fullstack Serverless GraphQL apps:

* [Insta Clone](https://github.com/pimp-my-book/insta-clone)
* [FDWA (Food Delivery Web App)](https://github.com/pimp-my-book/FDWA)
